0,JW Marriott or Marriott is always the best choice. We had a Birthday celebration and they upgraded our room to the best one. Staff is always courteous. It’s all their training. Breakfast is good but lunch and dinner are better. We are Marriott members since a long time and we will always continue to choose this brand for our stay. Cheers,5,eview Yesterday
1,Its expensive but they take good care of you. Rooms are cleaned everyday and the staff is warm and welcoming . My stay was great and everything seemed to be focussed on customer satisfaction and luxury. Will visit again.,5,e a review 18 Dec
2,"For a short stay, JWM Juhu offered a great city retreat. Food, service and room quality exceeded my expectations, but most importantly the warmth of the hotel staff made coming out of lockdown absolutely delightful.",5, review 16 Dec
3,"Having locked at home for 8 months, it was time to step out. But being pregnant and traveling with a 6 yr old daughter was a challenge.. Yet we needed a break from all the stressful days managing work and home on our own.. We didn't want to travel outside Mumbai and having heard of stayacations offerings from various hotels around we decided to go for this safest option.. After scanning through various luxurious hotels in Mumbai we decided JW Marriott, Juhu to be best option.. Located on Juhu Beach, ease to travel, and was offering a great deal with complimentary activities for kids (though their website mentioned different activities but whatever was offered kept my daughter happy). We had booked Deluxe room which was upgraded to premium category with best ocean view ever..  Our package included two buffet meals with high tea at Lotus Cafe the only restaurant functional for safety reasons. At restaurant we would like to mention few names  Nishal, Nikhil who ensured we are served well. The spread offered in buffet breakfast and dinner was very good with multiple options for vegetarian and non vegetarian and many live counters of Indian, International cuisine for breakfast dosas, puri, idlis, fresh fruit, juices, eggs, etc and for dinner like chaat, chillas, pizza, pasta, Korean, Chinese, soups, starters, wide selection of desserts from Bombay Baking Co. (in-house bakery shop), Indian sweets, ice cream etc. Even high tea had good offerings from sandwiches, mocktails, live counter of chaats, tea, coffee, milk for kids, veg and non veg puffs, quiche, nachos salsa dip, sweets etc.  Kids activities incl. Towel art, fish feeding, candle lighting, pizza making etc  Our room no. was 504 with best ocean view along with garden and pool view. We spend time relaxing in our room enjoying breathtaking view of the ocean.  The pool was closed but it could have kept clean.   The staff took great precautions on safety and sanitization. However, on Sunday breakfast there was rush and people had to wait in the queue.  Overall we had a great and restful stay. Afterall stayacation was not a bad idea Infact staying at JW Marriott, Juhu felt like staying at Goa or any other beach vacation. …",5,e a review 15 Dec

(in-house bakery shop), Indian sweets, ice cream etc. Even high tea had good offerings from sandwiches, mocktails, live counter of chaats, tea, coffee, milk for kids, veg and non veg puffs, quiche, nachos salsa dip, sweets etc.  Kids activities incl.

Located on Juhu Beach, ease to travel, and was offering a great deal with complimentary activities for kids (though their website mentioned different activities but whatever was offered kept my daughter happy). We had booked Deluxe room which was upgraded to premium category with best ocean view ever..  Our package included two buffet meals with high tea at Lotus Cafe the only restaurant functional for safety reasons. At restaurant we would like to mention few names  Nishal, Nikhil who ensured we are served well. The spread offered in buffet breakfast and dinner was very good with multiple options for vegetarian and non vegetarian and many live counters of Indian, International cuisine for breakfast dosas, puri, idlis, fresh fruit, juices, eggs, etc and for dinner like chaat, chillas, pizza, pasta, Korean, Chinese, soups, starters, wide selection of desserts from Bombay Baking Co. (in-house bakery shop), Indian sweets, ice cream etc. Even high tea had good offerings from sandwiches, mocktails, live counter of chaats, tea, coffee, milk for kids, veg and non veg puffs, quiche, nachos salsa dip, sweets etc.  Kids activities incl. Towel art, fish feeding, candle lighting, pizza making etc  Our room no. was 504 with best ocean view along with garden and pool view. We spend time relaxing in our room enjoying breathtaking view of the ocean.  The pool was closed but it could have kept clean.   The staff took great precautions on safety and sanitization. However, on Sunday breakfast there was rush and people had to wait in the queue.  Overall we had a great and restful stay. Afterall stayacation was not a bad idea Infact staying at JW Marriott, Juhu felt like staying at Goa or any other beach vacation. …",5,e a review 15 Dec

210,JW Marriott or Marriott is always the best choice. We had a Birthday celebration and they upgraded our room to the best one. Staff is always courteous. It’s all their training. Breakfast is good but lunch and dinner are better. We are Marriott members since a long time and we will always continue to choose this brand for our stay. Cheers,5,eview Yesterday

We had booked Deluxe room which was upgraded to premium category with best ocean view ever..  Our package included two buffet meals with high tea at Lotus Cafe the only restaurant functional for safety reasons. At restaurant we would like to mention few names  Nishal, Nikhil who ensured we are served well. The spread offered in buffet breakfast and dinner was very good with multiple options for vegetarian and non vegetarian and many live counters of Indian, International cuisine for breakfast dosas, puri, idlis, fresh fruit, juices, eggs, etc and for dinner like chaat, chillas, pizza, pasta, Korean, Chinese, soups, starters, wide selection of desserts from Bombay Baking Co. (in-house bakery shop), Indian sweets, ice cream etc. Even high tea had good offerings from sandwiches, mocktails, live counter of chaats, tea, coffee, milk for kids, veg and non veg puffs, quiche, nachos salsa dip, sweets etc.  Kids activities incl. Towel art, fish feeding, candle lighting, pizza making etc  Our room no. was 504 with best ocean view along with garden and pool view. We spend time relaxing in our room enjoying breathtaking view of the ocean.  The pool was closed but it could have kept clean.   The staff took great precautions on safety and sanitization. However, on Sunday breakfast there was rush and people had to wait in the queue.  Overall we had a great and restful stay. Afterall stayacation was not a bad idea Infact staying at JW Marriott, Juhu felt like staying at Goa or any other beach vacation. …",5,e a review 15 Dec

We had booked Deluxe room which was upgraded to premium category with best ocean view ever..  Our package included two buffet meals with high tea at Lotus Cafe the only restaurant functional for safety reasons. At restaurant we would like to mention few names  Nishal, Nikhil who ensured we are served well. The spread offered in buffet breakfast and dinner was very good with multiple options for vegetarian and non vegetarian and many live counters of Indian, International cuisine for breakfast dosas, puri, idlis, fresh fruit, juices, eggs, etc and for dinner like chaat, chillas, pizza, pasta, Korean, Chinese, soups, starters, wide selection of desserts from Bombay Baking Co. (in-house bakery shop), Indian sweets, ice cream etc. Even high tea had good offerings from sandwiches, mocktails, live counter of chaats, tea, coffee, milk for kids, veg and non veg puffs, quiche, nachos salsa dip, sweets etc.  Kids activities incl. Towel art, fish feeding, candle lighting, pizza making etc  Our room no. was 504 with best ocean view along with garden and pool view. We spend time relaxing in our room enjoying breathtaking view of the ocean.  The pool was closed but it could have kept clean.   The staff took great precautions on safety and sanitization. However, on Sunday breakfast there was rush and people had to wait in the queue.  Overall we had a great and restful stay. Afterall stayacation was not a bad idea Infact staying at JW Marriott, Juhu felt like staying at Goa or any other beach vacation. …",5,e a review 15 Dec

We had booked Deluxe room which was upgraded to premium category with best ocean view ever..  Our package included two buffet meals with high tea at Lotus Cafe the only restaurant functional for safety reasons. At restaurant we would like to mention few names  Nishal, Nikhil who ensured we are served well. The spread offered in buffet breakfast and dinner was very good with multiple options for vegetarian and non vegetarian and many live counters of Indian, International cuisine for breakfast dosas, puri, idlis, fresh fruit, juices, eggs, etc and for dinner like chaat, chillas, pizza, pasta, Korean, Chinese, soups, starters, wide selection of desserts from Bombay Baking Co. (in-house bakery shop), Indian sweets, ice cream etc. Even high tea had good offerings from sandwiches, mocktails, live counter of chaats, tea, coffee, milk for kids, veg and non veg puffs, quiche, nachos salsa dip, sweets etc.  Kids activities incl. Towel art, fish feeding, candle lighting, pizza making etc  Our room no. was 504 with best ocean view along with garden and pool view. We spend time relaxing in our room enjoying breathtaking view of the ocean.  The pool was closed but it could have kept clean.   The staff took great precautions on safety and sanitization. However, on Sunday breakfast there was rush and people had to wait in the queue.  Overall we had a great and restful stay. Afterall stayacation was not a bad idea Infact staying at JW Marriott, Juhu felt like staying at Goa or any other beach vacation. …",5,e a review 15 Dec

Located on Juhu Beach, ease to travel, and was offering a great deal with complimentary activities for kids (though their website mentioned different activities but whatever was offered kept my daughter happy). We had booked Deluxe room which was upgraded to premium category with best ocean view ever..  Our package included two buffet meals with high tea at Lotus Cafe the only restaurant functional for safety reasons. At restaurant we would like to mention few names  Nishal, Nikhil who ensured we are served well. The spread offered in buffet breakfast and dinner was very good with multiple options for vegetarian and non vegetarian and many live counters of Indian, International cuisine for breakfast dosas, puri, idlis, fresh fruit, juices, eggs, etc and for dinner like chaat, chillas, pizza, pasta, Korean, Chinese, soups, starters, wide selection of desserts from Bombay Baking Co. (in-house bakery shop), Indian sweets, ice cream etc. Even high tea had good offerings from sandwiches, mocktails, live counter of chaats, tea, coffee, milk for kids, veg and non veg puffs, quiche, nachos salsa dip, sweets etc.  Kids activities incl. Towel art, fish feeding, candle lighting, pizza making etc  Our room no. was 504 with best ocean view along with garden and pool view. We spend time relaxing in our room enjoying breathtaking view of the ocean.  The pool was closed but it could have kept clean.   The staff took great precautions on safety and sanitization. However, on Sunday breakfast there was rush and people had to wait in the queue.  Overall we had a great and restful stay. Afterall stayacation was not a bad idea Infact staying at JW Marriott, Juhu felt like staying at Goa or any other beach vacation. …",5,e a review 15 Dec

After scanning through various luxurious hotels in Mumbai we decided JW Marriott, Juhu to be best option.. Located on Juhu Beach, ease to travel, and was offering a great deal with complimentary activities for kids (though their website mentioned different activities but whatever was offered kept my daughter happy). We had booked Deluxe room which was upgraded to premium category with best ocean view ever..  Our package included two buffet meals with high tea at Lotus Cafe the only restaurant functional for safety reasons. At restaurant we would like to mention few names  Nishal, Nikhil who ensured we are served well. The spread offered in buffet breakfast and dinner was very good with multiple options for vegetarian and non vegetarian and many live counters of Indian, International cuisine for breakfast dosas, puri, idlis, fresh fruit, juices, eggs, etc and for dinner like chaat, chillas, pizza, pasta, Korean, Chinese, soups, starters, wide selection of desserts from Bombay Baking Co. (in-house bakery shop), Indian sweets, ice cream etc. Even high tea had good offerings from sandwiches, mocktails, live counter of chaats, tea, coffee, milk for kids, veg and non veg puffs, quiche, nachos salsa dip, sweets etc.  Kids activities incl. Towel art, fish feeding, candle lighting, pizza making etc  Our room no. was 504 with best ocean view along with garden and pool view. We spend time relaxing in our room enjoying breathtaking view of the ocean.  The pool was closed but it could have kept clean.   The staff took great precautions on safety and sanitization. However, on Sunday breakfast there was rush and people had to wait in the queue.  Overall we had a great and restful stay.

After scanning through various luxurious hotels in Mumbai we decided JW Marriott, Juhu to be best option.. Located on Juhu Beach, ease to travel, and was offering a great deal with complimentary activities for kids (though their website mentioned different activities but whatever was offered kept my daughter happy). We had booked Deluxe room which was upgraded to premium category with best ocean view ever..  Our package included two buffet meals with high tea at Lotus Cafe the only restaurant functional for safety reasons. At restaurant we would like to mention few names  Nishal, Nikhil who ensured we are served well. The spread offered in buffet breakfast and dinner was very good with multiple options for vegetarian and non vegetarian and many live counters of Indian, International cuisine for breakfast dosas, puri, idlis, fresh fruit, juices, eggs, etc and for dinner like chaat, chillas, pizza, pasta, Korean, Chinese, soups, starters, wide selection of desserts from Bombay Baking Co. (in-house bakery shop), Indian sweets, ice cream etc. Even high tea had good offerings from sandwiches, mocktails, live counter of chaats, tea, coffee, milk for kids, veg and non veg puffs, quiche, nachos salsa dip, sweets etc.  Kids activities incl. Towel art, fish feeding, candle lighting, pizza making etc  Our room no. was 504 with best ocean view along with garden and pool view. We spend time relaxing in our room enjoying breathtaking view of the ocean.  The pool was closed but it could have kept clean.   The staff took great precautions on safety and sanitization. However, on Sunday breakfast there was rush and people had to wait in the queue.  Overall we had a great and restful stay.

After scanning through various luxurious hotels in Mumbai we decided JW Marriott, Juhu to be best option.. Located on Juhu Beach, ease to travel, and was offering a great deal with complimentary activities for kids (though their website mentioned different activities but whatever was offered kept my daughter happy). We had booked Deluxe room which was upgraded to premium category with best ocean view ever..  Our package included two buffet meals with high tea at Lotus Cafe the only restaurant functional for safety reasons. At restaurant we would like to mention few names  Nishal, Nikhil who ensured we are served well. The spread offered in buffet breakfast and dinner was very good with multiple options for vegetarian and non vegetarian and many live counters of Indian, International cuisine for breakfast dosas, puri, idlis, fresh fruit, juices, eggs, etc and for dinner like chaat, chillas, pizza, pasta, Korean, Chinese, soups, starters, wide selection of desserts from Bombay Baking Co. (in-house bakery shop), Indian sweets, ice cream etc. Even high tea had good offerings from sandwiches, mocktails, live counter of chaats, tea, coffee, milk for kids, veg and non veg puffs, quiche, nachos salsa dip, sweets etc.  Kids activities incl. Towel art, fish feeding, candle lighting, pizza making etc  Our room no. was 504 with best ocean view along with garden and pool view. We spend time relaxing in our room enjoying breathtaking view of the ocean.  The pool was closed but it could have kept clean.   The staff took great precautions on safety and sanitization. However, on Sunday breakfast there was rush and people had to wait in the queue.  Overall we had a great and restful stay.

After scanning through various luxurious hotels in Mumbai we decided JW Marriott, Juhu to be best option.. Located on Juhu Beach, ease to travel, and was offering a great deal with complimentary activities for kids (though their website mentioned different activities but whatever was offered kept my daughter happy). We had booked Deluxe room which was upgraded to premium category with best ocean view ever..  Our package included two buffet meals with high tea at Lotus Cafe the only restaurant functional for safety reasons. At restaurant we would like to mention few names  Nishal, Nikhil who ensured we are served well. The spread offered in buffet breakfast and dinner was very good with multiple options for vegetarian and non vegetarian and many live counters of Indian, International cuisine for breakfast dosas, puri, idlis, fresh fruit, juices, eggs, etc and for dinner like chaat, chillas, pizza, pasta, Korean, Chinese, soups, starters, wide selection of desserts from Bombay Baking Co. (in-house bakery shop), Indian sweets, ice cream etc. Even high tea had good offerings from sandwiches, mocktails, live counter of chaats, tea, coffee, milk for kids, veg and non veg puffs, quiche, nachos salsa dip, sweets etc.  Kids activities incl. Towel art, fish feeding, candle lighting, pizza making etc  Our room no. was 504 with best ocean view along with garden and pool view. We spend time relaxing in our room enjoying breathtaking view of the ocean.  The pool was closed but it could have kept clean.   The staff took great precautions on safety and sanitization. However, on Sunday breakfast there was rush and people had to wait in the queue.  Overall we had a great and restful stay.

After scanning through various luxurious hotels in Mumbai we decided JW Marriott, Juhu to be best option.. Located on Juhu Beach, ease to travel, and was offering a great deal with complimentary activities for kids (though their website mentioned different activities but whatever was offered kept my daughter happy). We had booked Deluxe room which was upgraded to premium category with best ocean view ever..  Our package included two buffet meals with high tea at Lotus Cafe the only restaurant functional for safety reasons. At restaurant we would like to mention few names  Nishal, Nikhil who ensured we are served well. The spread offered in buffet breakfast and dinner was very good with multiple options for vegetarian and non vegetarian and many live counters of Indian, International cuisine for breakfast dosas, puri, idlis, fresh fruit, juices, eggs, etc and for dinner like chaat, chillas, pizza, pasta, Korean, Chinese, soups, starters, wide selection of desserts from Bombay Baking Co. (in-house bakery shop), Indian sweets, ice cream etc. Even high tea had good offerings from sandwiches, mocktails, live counter of chaats, tea, coffee, milk for kids, veg and non veg puffs, quiche, nachos salsa dip, sweets etc.  Kids activities incl. Towel art, fish feeding, candle lighting, pizza making etc  Our room no. was 504 with best ocean view along with garden and pool view. We spend time relaxing in our room enjoying breathtaking view of the ocean.  The pool was closed but it could have kept clean.   The staff took great precautions on safety and sanitization. However, on Sunday breakfast there was rush and people had to wait in the queue.  Overall we had a great and restful stay.

After scanning through various luxurious hotels in Mumbai we decided JW Marriott, Juhu to be best option.. Located on Juhu Beach, ease to travel, and was offering a great deal with complimentary activities for kids (though their website mentioned different activities but whatever was offered kept my daughter happy). We had booked Deluxe room which was upgraded to premium category with best ocean view ever..  Our package included two buffet meals with high tea at Lotus Cafe the only restaurant functional for safety reasons. At restaurant we would like to mention few names  Nishal, Nikhil who ensured we are served well. The spread offered in buffet breakfast and dinner was very good with multiple options for vegetarian and non vegetarian and many live counters of Indian, International cuisine for breakfast dosas, puri, idlis, fresh fruit, juices, eggs, etc and for dinner like chaat, chillas, pizza, pasta, Korean, Chinese, soups, starters, wide selection of desserts from Bombay Baking Co. (in-house bakery shop), Indian sweets, ice cream etc. Even high tea had good offerings from sandwiches, mocktails, live counter of chaats, tea, coffee, milk for kids, veg and non veg puffs, quiche, nachos salsa dip, sweets etc.  Kids activities incl. Towel art, fish feeding, candle lighting, pizza making etc  Our room no. was 504 with best ocean view along with garden and pool view. We spend time relaxing in our room enjoying breathtaking view of the ocean.  The pool was closed but it could have kept clean.   The staff took great precautions on safety and sanitization. However, on Sunday breakfast there was rush and people had to wait in the queue.  Overall we had a great and restful stay.

After scanning through various luxurious hotels in Mumbai we decided JW Marriott, Juhu to be best option.. Located on Juhu Beach, ease to travel, and was offering a great deal with complimentary activities for kids (though their website mentioned different activities but whatever was offered kept my daughter happy). We had booked Deluxe room which was upgraded to premium category with best ocean view ever..  Our package included two buffet meals with high tea at Lotus Cafe the only restaurant functional for safety reasons. At restaurant we would like to mention few names  Nishal, Nikhil who ensured we are served well. The spread offered in buffet breakfast and dinner was very good with multiple options for vegetarian and non vegetarian and many live counters of Indian, International cuisine for breakfast dosas, puri, idlis, fresh fruit, juices, eggs, etc and for dinner like chaat, chillas, pizza, pasta, Korean, Chinese, soups, starters, wide selection of desserts from Bombay Baking Co. (in-house bakery shop), Indian sweets, ice cream etc. Even high tea had good offerings from sandwiches, mocktails, live counter of chaats, tea, coffee, milk for kids, veg and non veg puffs, quiche, nachos salsa dip, sweets etc.  Kids activities incl. Towel art, fish feeding, candle lighting, pizza making etc  Our room no. was 504 with best ocean view along with garden and pool view. We spend time relaxing in our room enjoying breathtaking view of the ocean.  The pool was closed but it could have kept clean.   The staff took great precautions on safety and sanitization. However, on Sunday breakfast there was rush and people had to wait in the queue.  Overall we had a great and restful stay.

(in-house bakery shop), Indian sweets, ice cream etc. Even high tea had good offerings from sandwiches, mocktails, live counter of chaats, tea, coffee, milk for kids, veg and non veg puffs, quiche, nachos salsa dip, sweets etc.  Kids activities incl.
